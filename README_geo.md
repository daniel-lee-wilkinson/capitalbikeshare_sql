Table: interpretation of the graph

| Polygon shade (destinations) | Dot colour (starts) | What it tells you                                   | Typical follow-up action                                                               |
|------------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Dark blue**<br>(many rides **ending**) | **Deep-red dot**          | High-turnover hub — lots of bikes start *and* finish here. | Maintain high dock capacity; schedule regular maintenance, little nightly re-balancing. |
| **Dark blue** | **No dot**                | Net **sink** ZIP — bikes accumulate.               | Add docks or valet service; offer incentives to ride bikes *out* of this area.         |
| **Pale blue**<br>(few rides ending) | **Deep-red dot**          | Net **source** hub — docks empty as bikes leave.   | Schedule truck returns or “ride-to” discounts back in during off-peak hours.           |
| **Pale blue** | **Pale-yellow dot**       | Light traffic in both directions.                  | Minimal docks are fine; monitor but no urgent action needed.                           |
| **Medium blue** | **Orange dot**            | Balanced ZIP — starts ≈ ends.                      | Normal operations; tweak only if short-term shortages appear.                          |

**Table**: Low Traffic Stations (very few starts and ZIP level ends are irrelevant - the station is barely used)

| Start Station Name                    | Start Rides | ZIP   |
|--------------------------------------|-------------|--------|
| 20th & E St NW                        | 1           | 20245 |
| 10th St & Constitution Ave NW        | 1           | 20530 |

| 21st St & Pennsylvania Ave NW        | 1           | 20427 |

These stations could be removed or consolidated. The ZIP is not operationally important, the docks are not being used and bikes are not piling up nearby.

**Table**: net sink ZIPs i.e. starts are low and the ZIP has many ending trips (bikes arrive but do not leave)

| Start Station Name                         | Start Rides | ZIP   |
|-------------------------------------------|-------------|--------|
| Georgia Ave & Dahlia St NW                | 1           | 20012 |

| 3rd St & Riggs Rd NE                      | 1           | 20011 |

These stations are receiving a lot of trips but see few starts. Therefore bikes are accumulating but not being ridden. Possible operational interventions include rebalancing, incentivising ride outs and adding signage.
